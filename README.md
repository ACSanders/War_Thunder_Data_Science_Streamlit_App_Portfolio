# War Thunder Data Science
### Unveiling War Thunder Trends and Vehicle Performance with Bayesian A/B Testing, k-Means Clustering, Regression, and Statistical Insights
Developed and maintained by A. C. Sanders (2025)

## Description
**War Thunder Data Science** is an interactive Streamlit app that leverages Bayesian A/B testing, k-means clustering, linear regression, and statistical methods to generate insights into War Thunder vehicle performance and player trends. Users can filter player data, analyze trends, uncover patterns, and explore different metrics like *K/D*, *Kills per Battle*, and *Win Rates*.

## Demo the App Here
[Launch the App](https://war-thunder-data-science.streamlit.app/)

## Key Features
1. Bayesian A/B testing on nation win rates
2. k-means clustering to segment vehicles based on K/D and performance
3. Linear regression applied to cluster data to predict win rates
4. Heatmap of win rates by nation and BR class
5. Interactive visualizations and data filtering
6. Aggregated statistics and insights covering various performance metrics like K/D, Kills per Battle, and Win Rates
